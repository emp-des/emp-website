With assistance from the California Department of Water Resources (CDFW), each month EMP scientists visit up to 28 (24 fixed and 4 floating) stations to sample water quality and biological communities (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates). EMP also services and maintains a network of 15 continuous water quality stations that provide data in real time through the California Data Exchange Network. Since 1975, these efforts have established an irreplaceable ecological record in the San Francisco estuary that has been used in dozens of peer-review scientific articles and technical reports. As a public endeavor, EMP embraces the principles of Open Science and makes the data it collects openly and freely available. This website provides yearly status-and-trends reports on water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates while also providing links to Environmental Data Initiative portals where quality-checked versions of EMP’s various datasets are available for download. Program History EMP was formed in response to water quality objectives set by California’s State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement.

The stations provide continuous measurements of 6 water quality parameters and up to 4 environmental parameters at select locations. State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP) Operations and Maintenance staff use these measurements to assess impacts and to adjust operations as necessary to comply with mandated water quality standards. The CEMP has been in operation since 1983. This report summarizes the results of continuous water quality monitoring at 15 sites for calendar year 2021. The stations are categorized into five regions. (Table 1, Figure 1): Northern Interior Delta, Southern Interior Delta, Central Delta, Confluence, and Grizzly &amp; Suisun Bays.

Each of the 15 monitoring stations collected continuous data for water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), surface-specific conductance (SpC), chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity. Additionally, sensors were installed at the Antioch, Mallard Island, and Martinez stations in the 1990’s to monitor bottom SpC. Along with river stage data measured at the Mallard Island and Martinez stations, these bottom SpC measurements determine compliance with the mandated salinity standard (also known as X2) set by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) in the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan. Except for bottom-specific conductance, all water samples were collected 1-meter below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. In contrast, bottom-specific conductance was measured at 1.5 meters above the channel bottom using a YSI EXO1 sonde. Water quality data was recorded at 15-minute intervals.

"],["00-dwq-info.html", "Discrete Water Quality", " Discrete Water Quality Background Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it. Typically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous). Analytes EMP collects data for six different field parameters and 18 different laboratory constituents. The analytes highlighted in this report are: Specific Conductance Turbidity Dissolved Ammonia Chlorophyll a Dissolved Nitrate+Nitrite Total Phosphorus Sites To analyze discrete water quality trends, the 24 fixed EMP stations are grouped into six regions of the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary: San Pablo Bay, Suisun and Grizzly Bay, Confluence, Central Delta, Southern Interior Delta, and Northern Interior Delta. Their locations are displayed below. Figure 1: Map of EMP’s discrete WQ field sites. "],["00-dwq-report.html", "Current Report Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction Water year 2022 was classified as critical in the Sacramento Valley due to ongoing drought; the previous year was classified as critical (source). Regional facet graphs for 2022 were created for each parameter. The minimum and maximum values were determined for each field parameter or laboratory analyte to show that year’s range; instances when a result fell below the reporting limit were excluded from these minimum and maximum calculations. When this occurred, for the corresponding graph, a vertical dashed line capped at the reporting limit was used to represent the presence of a non-detect. Specific Conductance Surface specific conductance varied greatly in 2022 across the sampling regions with the highest levels occurring in the western regions (San Pablo Bay, Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays, Confluence) due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. Surface specific conductance ranged from 119 μS/cm (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, August) to 44933 μS/cm (D41 in San Pablo Bay, October) in 2022. Median specific conductance values in 2022 (medSpCnd = 4227 μS/cm) were lower than the 2021 median (medSpCnd = 5101 μS/cm). Figure 1: Specific Conductance at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Turbidity Surface turbidity values ranged from 0.9 FNU (MD10A in Southern Interior Delta, November) to 109.3 FNU (NZS42 in Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays, April) in 2022. Median turbidity values in 2022 (medTurb = 9.1 FNU) were higher than the 2021 median (medTurb = 8.3 FNU). Figure 2: Turbidity at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Dissolved Ammonia Dissolved ammonia levels in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) to 0.29 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, January) in 2022. Ammonia levels are typically lower throughout the Delta and Bays, likely due to dilution and nitrification. Median dissolved ammonia values in 2022 (medNH3 = 0.05 mg/L) were lower than the 2021 median (medNH3 = 0.057 mg/L). Figure 3: Dissolved Ammonia at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll a values in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.5 μ/L (the reporting limit) to 65.2 μ/L (D41A in San Pablo Bay, August) in 2022. The highest levels of chlorophyll a were seen in the San Pablo Bay region during August. Median chlorophyll a values in 2022 (medChla = 2.08 μ/L) were lower than the 2021 median (medChla = 2.37 μ/L). This was due to a harmful algal bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section. Figure 4: Chlorophyll a at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite Dissolved nitrate + nitrite levels in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) to 5.47 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, February) in 2022. Median dissolved nitrate/nitrite values in 2022 (medDNN = 0.266 mg/L) were lower than the 2021 median (medDNN = 0.33 mg/L). The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent. Figure 5: Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. Total Phosphorus Total phosphorus levels in 2022 ranged from 0.021 mg/L (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, March) to 0.462 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, June) in 2022. Median specific conductance values in 2022 (medTotPhos = 0.091 mg/L) were lower than the 2021 median (medTotPhos = 0.097 mg/L).The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of total phosphorus concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent.

"],["00-benthic-info.html", "Benthic Invertebrates", " Benthic Invertebrates Background Benthic organisms are creatures that live at the bottom of water bodies. This includes invertebrates (animals without backbones) like clams, shrimp, crabs, worms, aquatic insects, and small crustaceans called amphipods. Some benthic organisms live in or on the soft mud of the San Francisco Estuary, while others attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces. There are also benthic vertebrates (animals with backbones) that include various fish species. Benthic organisms are a central part of the estuarine food web, consuming and consumed by other creatures. Every winter during low-tides, thousands of migrating shorebirds feast upon uncovered clams, crabs, and worms found in the mudflats. Humans can also take advantage of the low tides to harvest these organisms. Certain fish species, including juvenile salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon, also consume many types of benthic organisms. A large percentage of the benthic organisms found in the San Francisco Estuary are non-native, and some of these species can have negative effects on the health of the estuary. For example, non-native clams can filter out much of the available phytoplankton, outcompeting the zooplankton who in turn are major sources of fish food. Historically, shrimp supported a large commercial fishery in San Francisco Estuary, and California’s commercial Dungeness crab fishery still depends upon crabs that spend the first two years of their life growing in the San Francisco Estuary. Changes in benthic organisms’ populations can be indications of larger changes in the physical conditions and water quality of the San Francisco Estuary, including alterations in pollution levels, freshwater inflows, salinity, and sediment composition. Monitoring The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) has been sampling benthic invertebrates in the San Francisco Estuary since 1975. The benthic monitoring program is one element of DWR’s and USBR’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton and phytoplankton. The overall objective of the benthic monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in benthic fauna presence, abundance and distribution associated physical factors in the estuary. Data collected from the benthic monitoring program is also used to detect newly introduced species in the estuary. Geographic coverage of the sampling sites ranges from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne and San Joaquin rivers (see Figure 42). The study area currently comprises ten sites that are sampled monthly. These sites represent a wide variety of habitats that vary in size and physical make-up as well as water quality and sediment composition. The aquatic habitats sampled range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays. The mixing of river water with tidal water creates a wide range of water quality conditions. For example, salinity ranges from freshwater to around 29 ppt in the most western sites. A 0.052 m2 Ponar dredge is used to sample the benthic sediment, and all organisms larger than 0.5 mm are identified and enumerated by taxonomy contractors. To date, 414 species in ten phyla (Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nemertea, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Chordata, Phoronida and Echinodermata) have been collected from the study area. Sediment composition data are also collected as part of the benthic monitoring program to document general trends in sediment composition for all sites where benthic samples are collected. Figure 1: Map of EMP’s benthic field sites (past and current). "],["00-benthic-meta.html", "Metadata", " Metadata Period of Record Benthic monitoring began in 1975. From 1975 through 1979 the program collected samples biannually from 18 to 35 stations, for a total of 48 stations over the period. In reviewing data collected between 1975 and 1979, it became evident that semi annual monitoring was insufficient to reveal long term ecological changes as mandated by Water Right Decision 1485. In 1980, DWR revised the benthic monitoring program and began monthly sampling at nine stations. In 1995, major program revisions were implemented to the program. A review of the data collected from 1980 to 1990 recommended that across-channel sampling be reduced to a single station per location in the Delta so that the geographic coverage could be widened. These revisions included increasing the number of sites sampled each month from nine to ten and increasing the number of grab sample replicates from three to four. Detailed information about location, number and characteristics of the historical sites can be found in IEP Technical Report 12 (Markmann, 1986) and IEP Technical Report 38 (Hymanson, et al., 1994). A programmatic review of the EMP in 2001-2002 found that the benthos monitoring element was particularly in need of fundamental and comprehensive consideration through intense special studies and study design examination. Reviewers recommended a temporary reduction in sampling frequency to free up EMP resources to conduct the more spatially intense sampling without requiring additional resources. October 2003 was the last of the monthly sampling events and sampling continued quarterly (in October, January, April, July) at the stations sampled through October 2005 when monthly sampling resumed. Sampling Frequency Biannual sampling was conducted in late spring and fall, from 1975 to 1979. Monthly sampling started in June 1980 and ended in October 2003. Samples were collected quarterly from October 2003 through October 2005. Currently samples are collected monthly. Sample Sites A list of the stations at which benthic invertebrate sampling has occurred is available here. Note: Coordinates are in decimal degrees, and channel position is determined while facing downstream. Field Collection Methods Benthos All samples are collected using a hydraulic winch and Ponar dredge. The Ponar dredge samples a bottom area of about 0.052 m2 to a depth that varies with the type of sediment and the ability of the dredge to penetrate it. Under the current program four replicate sample grabs are collected at each sampling site. The contents of the dredge are brought to the surface and placed in a large plastic bucket. Water is then added to the sample to create slurry. The contents of each grab sample bucket are washed over Standard No. 30 stainless steel mesh screen (0.595 mm openings). Each sample is carefully washed with a fine spray to remove as much of the substrate as possible. All material remaining on the screen after washing is preserved in a solution of approximately 20% buffered formaldehyde containing Rose Bengal dye for laboratory analysis. The benthic macroinvertebrate sampling methodology used in this program is described in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 20th ed. 1998 American Public Health Association, Washington D.C. (See pages 10-60 through 10-74.) Sediment Sediment samples are also collected as part of the benthic monitoring program. Samples are collected using the same hydraulic winch and Ponar dredge as the infaunal sampling. A single sediment grab is taken at each sampling site. The contents of the Ponar dredge are emptied into a plastic tub and a random subsample is placed into a 1-liter plastic jar for storage and transport to the DWR Soils Laboratory for analysis. Lab Processing Methods Benthos At the laboratory, the volume of settleable substrate in each sample jar is estimated and recorded. The formalin fixative is poured off and the sample is thoroughly washed on a 30-mesh (0.6 mm) screen. The composition of the substrate is estimated and recorded noting the relative percentages of peat, sand, mica, organic detritus, and other materials. The substrate is hand picked for organisms under a three diopter illuminated magnifier. Organisms are placed in 70% ethyl alcohol for subsequent identification. A stereoscopic dissecting microscope (70-120x) is used to identify most organisms. When taxonomic features are too small for identification under the dissecting scope, the organism is permanently mounted on a slide and examined under a compound microscope. If more than four hours of picking is required, and a sample contains many organisms but few species, a one-fourth subsample is chosen at random. The subsample is picked and the results are multiplied by four to represent the total sample. The remainder of the sample is inspected to make sure no other taxa were overlooked. Laboratory identification and enumeration of macro-benthic organisms in each sample is performed under contract by Hydrozoology Laboratory, P.O. Box 682 Newcastle, CA 95658. Analysis has been done by Hydrozoology for the program’s entire period of record. Sediment All sediment samples are analyzed by the DWR Soils Laboratory, West Sacramento, CA. Analysis of a sediment sample involves determining the percent size fractions with the use of a mechanical sieve. The sieves sizes are as follow: 75, 37.5, 19, 9.5, 4.75, 2.36, 1.18, 0.6, 0.3, 0.15, 0.075, 0.005, 0.002, 0.001 mm. All particle sizes are found on a regular basis in the samples with the exception of gravel (particles greater than 4.76 mm in diameter). The percent organic content of each sediment sample is also determined from the loss in weight of an oven-dried sample burned at 440 degrees Celsius for 8 hours. All laboratory analysis procedures follow the American Society for Testing Methods, D-2974, “Moisture, Ash, and Organic Matter”and D-422-63, “Particle-Size Analysis of Soil”.

IEP Technical Report 12. 51 pp. "],["00-benthic-report.html", "Current Report Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction Benthic monitoring conducted by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) since 1975 has documented changes in the composition, density, and distribution of the macrobenthic biota inhabiting the upper San Francisco Estuary. This monitoring is performed by the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) as part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) and is one component of the biological monitoring mandated by Water Right Decision D-1641. Since benthic species respond to changes in physical factors such as freshwater inflows, salinity, and substrate composition, benthic community data provides an indication of physical changes occurring within the Estuary. Benthic monitoring is an important component of the EMP because operation of the State Water Project can change the Estuary’s flow characteristics, affecting the density and distribution of benthic biota. Benthic monitoring data is also used to detect and document the presence of new, non-native species in the Upper Estuary, such as the 1986 arrival and subsequent wide spread of the overbite clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. This article summarizes benthic community characteristics at EMP monitoring sites in 2022 and contextualizes these observations using community data from the preceding decade. Methods Benthic monitoring was conducted monthly at 10 sampling sites distributed throughout the Estuary, from San Pablo Bay upstream through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Figure 41). EMP staff collected four bottom grab samples at each station using a Ponar dredge with a sampling area of 0.052 m2. The four replicate grab samples were analyzed for benthic macrofauna by Hydrozoology, a private laboratory under contract with DWR. All organisms were identified to the lowest taxon possible and enumerated. Field collection methodology and laboratory analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates are described in detail in the benthic metadata found here. Figure 1: Map of EMP’s current benthic field sites. Results The benthic fauna collected in 2022 comprised nine phyla: Annelida (42% of total organisms), Arthropoda (28%) and Mollusca (30%), with Phoronida, Nematoda, Chordata, Platyhelminthes, Cnidaria, and Nemertea each representing1% or less of total organisms. Of the 200 benthic species collected in 2022, the ten most abundant species represented 70% of all individuals collected throughout the year (Table 1). These include three species of amphipod, two clams, two oligochate worms, two polychate worms, and one cumacean arthropod (also known as a comma shrimp, although it is not actually a shrimp). Only one species in this group (the amphipod Americorophium spinicorne) is native to this estuary. The rest of the top ten species are non-native or are cosmopolitan species of unknown origin. Refer to Fields and Messer (1999) for descriptions of the habitat requirements, physical attributes, and feeding methods of many of these species. Figure 2: List of ten most numerous benthic invertebrate species found at EMP sites in 2022. In the site descriptions that follow, most species densities are reported as the annual densities of individuals/m2, sometimes noting dramatic seasonal peaks. Some species, especially arthropods, display strong seasonal variability with peak monthly densities several times higher than their annual densities. In these cases, we reported the time and magnitude of the peaks as well as the annual densities. Please note that the station P8 was not sampled in December 2022 due to heavy fog, and comparisons to other years’ average annual densities or seasonal patterns should take this omission into account. Readers who wish to see the full dataset and its associated metadata can access here. North Delta (D24) Site D24 is located on the Sacramento River, just south of the Rio Vista Bridge (Figure 41). There were 19 species in six phyla at D24. Mollusca was the most abundant phylum for much of the year and made up 83% of all organisms collected at the station (Figure 43). A large majority (80%) of the individual organisms found at D24 in 2021 were the non-native clam Corbicula fluminea, with an annual average density of 1,595 individuals/m2. Corbicula fluminea density in 2022 was a decline from the high densities of 2018-2020, which peaked with 2020’s annual average of 3,756 individuals/m2. The second most abundant organism was the non-native amphipod Gammarus daiberi with an annual density of 230 individuals/m2, which was a similar decline from a 2020 peak of 1,078 individuals/m2. Besides these notable declines from 2020 peaks, the composition of the community at D24 in 2022 was similar to other years in the last decade. Figure 3: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D24 in 2022. Central Delta (D16, D28A) The benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations, in the Central Delta, D16 and D28. Site D16 is on the lower San Joaquin River near Twitchell Island (Figure 41). There were 19 species in three phyla at D16 in 2022, split largely between Arthropoda (48% of all organisms collected in 2020), Mollusca (36%), and Annelida (16%), (Figure 44). The most abundant species at D16 was the clam Corbicula fluminea which accounted for 33% of all organisms in 2022, with an average annual density of 93 individuals/m2 and a peak in March of 308 individuals/m2. The amphipod Americorophium spinicorne was the second most abundant organism, accounting for 32% of all individuals, with an average annual density of 92 individuals/m2 and a drastic peak in February of 1034 individuals/m2. Much of the rest of the community was a combination of multiple species of amphipods and other annelid worms at lower densities. The total number of organisms at D16 in 2022 was slightly increased from the very low numbers of 2020 and 2021, but was still lower than other years in the previous decade In particular, 2020-2022 saw very low numbers of the amphipod Americorophium spinicorne, which has vwwn seen in very high numbers from 2015-2018. The site on Old River near Rancho Del Rio is known as D28A (Figure 41). In 2022, there were 70 species in seven phyla at D28A, and this site had the largest number of individual organisms collected. The most abundant phylum was Annelida, followed by Arthropoda and Mollusca (61%, 34%, and 4% of all organisms, respectively) (Figure 45). The most abundant species was the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa with an annual density of 1,726 individuals/m2 and a notable peak in March of 4,577 individuals/m2. Next most abundant was the oligochaete worm Variachaetadrilus angustipenis, with an annual density of 1,609 individuals/m2, followed by the amphipods Gammarus daiberi and Americorophium spinicorne, with annual densities of 1,044 and 903 individuals/m2. Both these amphipod species had marked peaks in June and July, with low densities the rest of the year. Site D28A had annual total densities of organisms that were comparable to other years in the past decade, and also similarly high species richness. Figure 4: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D16 in 2022. Figure 5: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D28A in 2022. South Delta (P8, C9) The benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the South Delta. Site P8 is on the San Joaquin River at Buckley Cove (Figure 41). Station P8 had a total of 64 species in six phyla in 2022. Annelida was by far the most abundant phyla at this station in 2022, accounting for 86% of all organisms collected (Figure 46). The dominant species driving most of the Annelida patterns was the non-native sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa, which had an annual density of 2,594 individuals/m2 and accounted by itself for 42% of all organisms. Manayunkia speciosa in 2022 remained moderately higher than its lowest densities in 2018 and 2020, but nowhere near the high densities seen from 2012 to 2015 which peaked at 11,338 individuals/m2 in 2015. The oligochate worms Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Varichaetadrilus angustipenis were the next most common organisms at 1,514 and 505 individuals/m2 annual density, followed by a long tail of many species represented at low densities. This community composition has remained largely unchanged through the last decade, apart from the notable boom and bust of M. speciosa. Site C9 is on Old River at the Clifton Court Forebay intake (Figure 41). There were 87 species in seven phyla at C9 in 2022, a tie with 2021’s record high for site species richness. Annelida was the dominant phylum throughout the year, accounting for 69% of all organisms collected in 2020, followed by 25% Arthropoda. (Figure 47). An oligochaete worm, Varichaetadrilus angustipenis, made up 28% of all organisms with an annual density of 1,316 individuals/m2, which was less than half its density in 2021 and roughly a third of the high-density years of 2012, 2013, and 2019; it reached similar lows in the drought years of 2015 and 2016. The freshwater amphipod Hyalella sp. A ranked second with an annual average of 740 individuals/m2, most of which were seen in a peak of 3,129 individuals/m2 in November. Like V. angustipenis, Hyalella had very low annual densities in 2022, and these have declined steadily since 2012. The oligochaete worms Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Ilyodrilus frantzi complete the list of higher-density organisms, at 621 and 502 individuals/m2. Similar to P8, C9 has a large number of low-density species, including the highest diversity of aquatic insect larvae at any site sampled (27 species in 2022, mostly chironomid midges). The community was dominated by oligochates and had the same overal composition as it has for many years, but 2022 saw a notably lower average CPUE than at any time in the last decade. Figure 6: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station P8 in 2022. Figure 7: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station C9 in 2022. Confluence (D4) Site D4 is located near the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, just north of Point Sacramento (Figure 41). There were 41 species in four phyla at D4 in 2022, and the second largest numbrr of total organisms in 2022. Arthropoda was the most abundant phylum (51% of all organisms) followed by Annelida (25% of all organisms) and Mollusca (24% of all organisms) (Figure 48). The native amphipod Americorophium spinicorne was the most abundant species at this station, and made up slightly over 35% of all individual organisms in 2022 with a dramatic seasonal peak of 23,8052 individuals/m2 in May 2022 but an annual average considerably lower than any year since 2016. The invasive bivalve Potamocorbula amurensis was second, with an annual average density of 1,296 individuals/m2, up moderately from the low densities of the preceding decade. The annelid Laonome calida came next with an annual density of 1,093 individuals/m2. Because of D4’s position at the front of saltwater and freshwater mixing in the estuary, we often see a shift from the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea to more brackish-water Potamocorbula amurensis in dry years, and indeed the recent high densities of Corbicula from 2017 through 2019 continued to decline while Potamocorbula increased over the same time period. 2022 was also notable for its continued decrease in A. spinicorne in 2022 from the peaks in 2019 and 2020. Like C9, D4 in 2022 had the lowest overall lower average density of total organism it has seen in a decade. Figure 8: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D4 in 2022. Suisun Bay (D6 and D7) The benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the Suisun Bay area, D6 and D7. Site D6 is in Suisun Bay near the I-680 bridge (Figure 41) and had 28 species in five phyla in 2022. Mollusca was the dominant phylum, accounting for 91% of all organisms collected (Figure 49). Most of the organisms collected were the invasive Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which had an annual density of 4,600 individuals/m2, in a considerable decrease from its 2020 high of 22,708 individuals/m2. Potamocorbula amurensis was most abundant in from June through October. The relatively few other organisms found at this site were predominately from phylum Arthropoda (mostly the brackish-water bay barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus, found mostly growing on P. amurensis shells). 2022 saw the lowest number of P. amurensis in over a decade at D6. Site D7 is in Grizzly Bay, near the entrance to Suisun Slough (Figure 41). There were 30 species in five phyla in 2022. Arthropoda comprised 49% of the total organisms, Mollusca 43%, and Annelida 8%. The cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis and the non-native clam Potamocorbula amurensis were the two most abundant species, comprising 44% and 43% of the total community through the year, respectively (Figure 50). For the first time since the invasion of P. amurensis, there were fewer P. amurensis than N. hinumensis in 2022 at D7. Nippoleucon hinumensis had an annual density of 2,298 organisms/m2, but saw a strong seasonal pattern: relatively high densities from March through June and relatively lower densities the rest of the year. Potamocorbula amurensis had an annual average density of 2,241/organisms/m2. While P. amurensis has been numerically dominant through the last decade, a major change in 2022 was the rise of N. hinumensis and a simultaneous crash of the amphipod Sinocorophium alienense, which had been the second-densest species at D7 for at least the last decade. Sinocorophium alienense crashed in 2021 to around 300 organisms/m2, and was completely absent from D7 in 2022. Figure 9: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D6 in 2022. Figure 10: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D7 in 2022. San Pablo Bay (D41, D41A) The benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in San Pablo Bay, D41 and D41A. Station D41 is near Point Pinole (Figure 41) and has a benthic community primarily comprised of marine organisms, especially in drier water years. There were 77 species in eight phyla at D41 in 2022. Arthropoda was the most abundant phylum (41% of all organisms) followed by Annelida (35%), Mollusca (11%) and Phoronida (11%) (Figure 51). The dominance of phylum Arthropoda was due almost entirely to the non-native amphipod Ampelisa abdita, and this one species comprised 38% of all organisms found at this station in 2021, with an annual average of 1,450 individuals/m2. Ampelisca abdita was most abundant from in June and July, peaking at 9,264 individuals/m2 in July and decreasing for much of the rest of the year. The second most abundant species was Phoronis harmeri, a native tube-dwelling filter-feeder, from the small marine lopophorate phylum Phoronida with had an average annual density of 415 individuals/m2 . The window shell clam Theora lubrica, along with the tube-dwelling spionid worm Pseudopolydora kempi and the polychaete worm Scoletoma luti, were the other species found in notable densities. D41 overall community composition in 2021 was similar to the preceding decade, and adds another year of evidence supporting the observation that higher-salinity years such as 2021 see density increases in more marine species such as Apelisca abdita, Phoronis harmeri, and Theora lubrica but lower numbers of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which prefers more brackish water and is mostly only seen at D41 in wetter water years. Station D41A is in San Pablo Bay near the mouth of the Petaluma River (Figure 41). There were 51 species in seven phyla at D41A in 2021. The most abundant phyla was Annelida (60% of all organisms), with Mollusca second (27%) and Arthropoda third (11%) (Figure 52). The two most numerous species were the window shell clam Theora lubrica and the spionid worm Pseudopolydora paucibranchia, which together made up 48% of all organisms in roughly equal numbers. The sabellid worm Euchone limnicola was third with 16% of the total organisms. All three of these species had summer peaks, with their highest densities in June and July. Theora lubrica peaked in July 2,072 individuals/m2, P. paucibranchia in July at 4,529 individuals/m2, and E. limnicola in June at 1,966 individuals/m2. The community in 2022 was lacking the species which had been numerically dominant for the previous decade: the amphipods Ampelisca abdita and Monocorophim acherusicum, the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, and the small cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis were at some of their lowest levels since 2012. Figure 11: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41 in 2022. Figure 12: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41A in 2022. Conclusion In summary, 2022 saw lower average organism density than any year of the past decade. This trend was consistent across most sites but was largely caused by decrease of previously high densities of Potamocorbula amurensis at stations D6 and D7, and various amphipod species at many other sites, especially Ampelisca abdita in San Pablo Bay and Sinocorophium alienense in Grizzly Bay. The freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea is also at low average densities in most upstream sites, along with the cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon himumensis in the Grizzly Bay, Suisun Bay, and Confluence stations. Since many fish species have switched to amphipod food sources after the collapse of mysid shrimps (Feyrer et al. 2003), the near disappearance of various amphipod and cumacean species may may have food web implications unless they have simply shifted its range out of our sampling area. Ordinarily, the decrease of both species of invasive clams and their filter-feeding activity would be a favorable sign for the ecosystem, and maybe their lower numbers in 2022 will be beneficial later on in 2023 if they allow other species to rebound, but the relative absence of several other numerically dominant members of the community in 2022 has unclear implications. Our ability to recognize these changes over decadal timescales highlights the importance of continued monitoring of benthic invertebrates to a high taxonomic resolution across the entire estuarine salinity gradient, as the community interacts with both various abiotic conditions as well as key parts of the estuarine food web.

Phytoplankton are small organisms that can be found floating in most water bodies. They occur as unicellular forms (single cell), colonial forms (multiple cells in a clump), filaments (long chains of cells), or flagellates (having flagella that give them some mobility). Like plants, they are primary producers; they convert light energy from the sun and carbon dioxide into the living matter of their cells through photosynthesis. Phytoplankton from the San Francisco Estuary fall into four broad categories: cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, and various flagellate groups. Cyanobacteria are the only phytoplankton that are true bacteria, meaning their cells’ internal structures do not have membranes around them. Often called blue-green algae due to their color, they have colonized nearly all freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats on earth. Some species can produce blooms and harmful toxins that degrade water quality. Diatoms are unique among phytoplankton because they have a cell wall made of glass, or silicon dioxide, called a frustule. They can be unicellular or colonial. There are two main types of diatoms, centric and pennate. Green algae are a large, diverse group of phytoplankton consisting of unicellular, filamentous, colonial, and flagellated forms. They are found in a wide variety of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats. Some species can form nuisance blooms or surface scums in nutrient-rich water. Flagellates include phytoplankton from many different groups, such as cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, haptophytes, and euglenoids. Some flagellates, like cryptophytes, can be important as food for zooplankton. Some groups of flagellates, such as haptophytes and dinoflagellates, can produce toxic blooms that can kill or poison fish and invertebrates. Why are phytoplankton important? Phytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web. They feed a diverse array of organisms, ranging from microscopic zooplankton to large pelagic fish. Small fish and benthic organisms also graze on phytoplankton, and are in turn consumed by larger organisms such as birds. Because of their importance as the base of the food web, changes in phytoplankton in the San Francisco Estuary can have cascading effects throughout the food web. For example, loss of phytoplankton species that are important food sources can negatively affect the zooplankton and fish species that feed on those phytoplankton, and thus negatively affect the animals preying on those zooplankton and fish. Phytoplankton can also affect elements of water quality such as pH, dissolved oxygen, taste and odor of drinking water, and water transparency. Large algal blooms, both toxic and non-toxic, can have adverse effects on the water quality parameters listed above. They can also have negative aesthetic effects by forming large, floating surface scums. Monitoring changes in phytoplankton can be useful in assessing water quality trends by detecting the presence of nuisance species or the development of large blooms that could require management action. Chlorophyll-a is the primary photosynthetic product made by phytoplankton and plants, and gives them their green color. Chlorophyll-a is also a measure of the biomass that is directly available to organisms that prey on phytoplankton, such as clams and zooplankton. Sometimes the green color is masked by secondary pigments, and these phytoplankton often appear brown or red instead of green. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting chloro¬phyll-a concentrations in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contrib¬uted to the low chlorophyll-a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s. By removing phytoplankton from the water, P. amurensis has reduced the amount of phytoplankton available to other organisms such as zooplankton. How is phytoplankton monitored? The California DWR Phytoplankton and Chlorophyll-a monitoring measures the composition (what kinds?), abundance (how many?), diversity (how many kinds?), and distribution (where are they?) of phytoplankton. It also measures phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a; both types of monitoring are performed as part of the IEP’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). Thirteen fixed sites are currently sampled for both phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a, with two additional sites sampled at variable locations based on bottom specific conductance of 2,000 and 6,000 micro-Siemens, respectively. Historically, samples were collected once or twice monthly at up to 33 sites. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly alongside the water quality and zooplankton sampling. Whole, unfiltered water samples are collected monthly from one meter below the surface to determine phytoplankton composition; Lugol’s solution is then added as a stain and preservative. For chlorophyll-a samples, water is filtered onto glass carbon fiber filters for analysis. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a data are available from 1975 to the present. Changes in phytoplankton composition, abundance, diversity, distribution, and biomass are monitored throughout the San Francisco Estuary, from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne, and San Joaquin Rivers. Because different phytoplankton species live in different parts of the Estuary, the sites represent a wide range of habitats of varying physical conditions, including wide ranges of salinity and temperature. Sites range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays. "],["00-phyto-report.html", "Current Report Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect phytoplankton and chlorophyll a samples to monitor algal community composition and biomass at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). The twenty-four sites range from San Pablo Bay to the inland rivers of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (“the Delta”). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays. This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for calendar year 2022. Phytoplankton are small, free-floating organisms that occur as unicellular, colonial, or filamentous forms (Horne and Goldman, 1994). Phytoplankton are a key component of the Estuary’s food web, serving as food for zooplankton, invertebrates, and certain fish species. Their metabolic processes also impact water chemistry, and their ability to fix carbon through photosynthesis is one of the key processes influencing water quality in the Estuary. Via this process, phytoplankton can affect the pH, dissolved oxygen, color, taste, and odor of natural waters. Under certain conditions, some species of phytoplankton (e.g., Microcystis aeruginosa) can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), releasing toxin compounds which can be dangerous or even lethal to animals and humans (Carmichael, 1981). In freshwater, the cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (class Cyanophyceae), are responsible for producing toxic blooms, particularly in waters that are polluted with phosphates (van den Hoek et al., 1995). Phytoplankton are also useful for assessing water quality (Gannon and Stemberger 1978); their short life cycles allow them to respond quickly to environmental changes, meaning their standing crop and species composition are indicative of source water characteristics (APHA 2012). However, because of their transient nature, patchiness, and free movement in a lotic environment, the utility of phytoplankton as water quality indicators is limited and should be interpreted in conjunction with other biological and physiochemical data (APHA 2012). In addition to collecting phytoplankton samples to assess community composition, we use the measured concentration of chlorophyll a as a proxy to infer phytoplankton biomass. Chlorophyll molecules are complex phytopigments found in most photosynthetic organisms. There are several types of chlorophyll, which are distinguished by slight differences in their molecular structures and constituents. These include chlorophyll a, b, c, and d, with a being the principal photosynthetic pigment in most phytoplankton. This makes the chlorophyll a pigment a reliable proxy measurement for phytoplankton biomass. In addition, we measured the concentration of a different pigment in our water samples, pheophytin a. Pheophytin a is a primary degradation product of chlorophyll a. Comparing its concentration relative to chlorophyll a is a useful metric for estimating the general physiological state of phytoplankton populations. When phytoplankton are actively growing, the concentrations of pheophytin a are normally expected to be low relative to chlorophyll a. Conversely, when the phytoplankton have died and are decaying, levels of pheophytin a are expected to be high in relation to chlorophyll a. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting amount of chlorophyll a in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis (Alpine and Cloern 1992). Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contributed to the low chlorophyll a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s (Alpine and Cloern 1992). Primary production by phytoplankton, primarily via carbon fixation through photosynthesis, is one of the key processes that influence water quality in the Estuary. Via this process, phytoplankton can affect pH, dissolved oxygen, color, taste, and odor. Under certain conditions, some species (eg. Microcystis aeruginosa) can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), resulting in animal deaths and human illness (Carmichael, 1981). In freshwater, the cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (class Cyanophyceae), are responsible for producing toxic blooms, particularly in waters that are polluted with phosphates (van den Hoek et al., 1995). Phytoplankton are also useful for assessing water quality (Gannon and Stemberger 1978); their short life cycles allow them to respond quickly to environmental changes, meaning their standing crop and species composition are indicative of source water characteristics (APHA 2012). However, because of their transient nature, patchiness, and free movement in a lotic environment, the utility of phytoplankton as water quality indicators is limited and should be interpreted in conjunction with other biological and physio-chemical data (APHA 2012). Methods Phytoplankton Phytoplankton samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary, which were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (Figure 1; Table 1). Samples were collected 1 meter below the water’s surface using a submersible pump and stored in 50 mL amber glass bottles. 200 µL of Lugol’s solution was added to each sample as a stain and preservative. All samples were kept at room temperature and away from direct sunlight until they were analyzed. Phytoplankton identification and enumeration were performed by BSA Environmental, Inc. according to the Utermöhl microscopic method (Utermöhl, 1958) and modified Standard Methods (APHA, 2012). An aliquot of sample was placed into a counting chamber and allowed to settle for a minimum of 12 hours. The aliquot volume, normally 10-20 mL, was adjusted according to the algal population density and the turbidity of the sample. Phytoplankton taxa were enumerated in randomly chosen transects for each settled aliquot. This process was performed at 800x magnification using a Leica DMIL inverted microscope. For each aliquot, a minimum of 400 total algal units were counted, with the dominant taxon accounting for a minimum of 100 algal units. For filamentous or colonial taxa, the number of cells per filament or colony was recorded. Raw organism counts were normalized to the sample volume using the following formula: \\(organisms/mL = {CA_c \\frac V{A_f}F}\\) where \\(C\\) is the organism count, \\(A_c\\) is the area of the cell bottom (mm\\(^2\\)), \\(A_f\\) is the area of each grid field (mm\\(^2\\)), \\(F\\) is the number of fields examined, and \\(V\\) is the settled volume (mL). This simplifies to: \\(organisms/mL = {\\frac C{cV}}\\) where \\(cV = {A_c \\frac V{A_f}F}\\) and is equal to the counted volume. The 10 most common genera were determined by summing the normalized organism counts across all stations and months for each genus. For the bar graphs, average organism counts were calculated per month, per region, and normalized to the number of stations.

Samples were collected by filtering a known volume of water through a glass-fiber filter (1.0 µm pore size) at a pressure of 10 mmHg. For turbid water (&gt; 20 NTU), 200 mL was filtered while 500mL of water was filtered when turbidity was &lt; 20 NTU to prevent clogging. Filters were immediately frozen and transported to DWR’s Bryte Laboratory for analysis using spectrophotometry in accordance with the Standard Method 10200 H (APHA, 2012). Samples were processed by mechanically grinding the filter and extracting phytopigments using acetone. Pigment absorption spectra were measured before and after acidification to quantify the amount of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a, respectively. Concentrations were calculated according to a formula specified in the methodology (APHA, 2012). Average analyte concentrations were then calculated per month, per region, and were normalized to the number of stations. Results Phytoplankton Identification All organisms collected in 2022 fell into these 10 algal groups: • Chrysophytes• Cryptophytes• Cyanobacteria• Diatoms (Pennate and Centric)• Dinoflagellates• Euglenoids• Green Algae• Haptophytes• Raphidophytes The 10 most common genera collected in 2022 were, in order:• Eucapsis (cyanobacteria)• Cyclotella (centric diatoms)• Plagioselmis (cryptophytes)• Nitzschia (pennate diatoms)• Chlorella (green algae)• Cocconeis (cyanobacteria)• Teleaulax (centric diatoms)• Cryptomonas (cryptophytes)• Monoraphidium (pennate diatoms)• Navicula (green algae) Of the 10 groups identified, cryptophytes, cyanobacteria, diatoms, and green algae constituted the vast majority (97.7%) of the organisms collected.

"],["00-zoop-info.html", "Zooplankton", " Zooplankton Background Zooplankton in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) serve as a vital trophic link between aquatic primary producers and higher trophic level consumers. As primary consumers of phytoplankton, zooplankton facilitate the flow of carbon through a large and complex food web that historically supported abundant fisheries (Schroeter et al. 2015; Kimmerer et al. 2018). Zooplankton in the SFE are a key food source for endangered and threatened fish species, notably the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Hobbs et al. 2006; Slater and Baxter 2014) .Many species of fish, including Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feed on zooplankton in the estuary as larvae and juveniles (Goertler et al. 2018; Heubach et al. 1963), while others like Tule Perch (Hysterocarpus traskii) and Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) include zooplankton in their diets throughout their lifetimes (Kimmerer 2006, Feyrer et al. 2003). The importance of zooplankton in the estuarine food web prompted the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1972 to assess the prey resources available to fish in the upper SFE. Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Board’s Water Right Decision 1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For over five decades this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distribution patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting dramatic shifts in community composition. Changes in zooplankton abundance and composition have been linked to major declines in pelagic fishes in the upper estuary (Sommer et al. 2007; Winder and Jassby 2011). Methods Zooplankton have been sampled since 1972, once or twice per month from March to November through 1994, and monthly from 1995 to the present, except during the COVID-19 pandemic, which precluded sampling in March and April 2020 and from December 2020 to February 2021. Samples are collected at 20 fixed stations in the upper SFE (Figure 1) using three gear types that target different size ranges of zooplankton: Teel Marine 12V utility pump samples filtered through a 43-micron mesh net for micro-zooplankton (rotifers, copepod nauplii, and small cyclopoid copepods); Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net with 160-micron mesh to sample meso-zooplankton (cladocerans and most juvenile and adult calanoid copepods); and mysid net with 505-micron mesh targeting mysid shrimp and other macro-zooplankton. The mysid and CB nets are mounted on the same tow sled and samples are collected in a 10-minute stepped oblique tow over the depth range of each station. The volume of water filtered during a net tow is used to calculate catch per unit effort (CPUE). Volume filtered during mysid and CB tows is determined by mounting a General Oceanics flowmeter in the mouth of each net. Volume filtered is calculated as: \\(V = (end meter - startmeter)k*a\\) where \\(k\\) is a flow meter collection value, and \\(a\\) is the area of the mouth of the net (mm\\(^2\\)). The Teel Marine pump samples 19.8 gallons over the upper 30’ of the water column, filtered through a 43-micron mesh net. All zooplankton samples are preserved immediately after collection in 10% formalin with rose bengal dye. Target organisms in each sample are identified and enumerated in the laboratory using dissecting microscopes. More information about the sampling and processing methods can be found in the metadata here. Abundance indices are calculated for each organism from its target gear type (noted above). Abundance is reported as mean CPUE, calculated as the number of each organism collected per cubic meter of water sampled: \\(CPUE=s*V^{-1}\\) where \\(s\\) is the estimated count of the target organism in the sample. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepod abundance indices reported here comprise adults only, as juveniles cannot always be identified to species. Annual and monthly abundance indices were calculated using 16 fixed stations sampled consistently since 1974 (Figure 1) and 2 to 4 non-fixed entrapment zone (EZ) stations, located where bottom specific conductance was 2 and 6 millisiemens per centimeter (approximately 1 and 3 psu). To analyze long-term trends (1974 to present), annual abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected from March through November, as winter sampling was inconsistent before 1995. Monthly abundances from 2022 are also shown by regions, as detailed in each section below. Estuary regions are designated as San Pablo Bay (stations D41, D41A), Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays (stations D6, 28, 48), Suisun Marsh (stations 32, S42), Confluence (stations 54, 60, 64, 74), Central Delta (stations D16, D19, 86, D28, M10), North Delta (68), South Delta (92) (Figure 1). In 2022 the non-fixed (EZ) stations were most often in the Confluence region with a few in the Central Delta and North Delta, mostly during fall and early winter months. During most months in 2022, two EZ stations were also sampled in the San Joaquin River in addition to the two EZ stations in the Sacramento River. Annual indices include data from the 16 core stations and the two Sacramento River EZ stations. Monthly CPUE by region for 2022 includes data from all fixed and EZ stations. "],["00-zoop-report.html", "Current Report Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction This report presents zooplankton annual and monthly abundances and distribution trends from 1974 through 2022 for the most common copepods (calanoid and cyclopoid), cladocerans, rotifers, and mysids of the upper estuary. Trends The overall abundance of zooplankton in the estuary has decreased significantly over the course of the Zooplankton Study (Figure 2). Cyclopoid copepods are the only group that has increased in abundance over the study period, driven by the invasion and spread of Limnoithona tetraspina. The overall decrease in zooplankton abundance can be attributed to invasive species colonizing the estuary, most notably the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer, Gartside, and Orsi 1994; Carlton et al. 1990). Abundances of both phytoplankton and zooplankton in the upper estuary have been impacted by the proliferation of P. amurensis, as it is a highly efficient filter feeder and consumes both phytoplankton and copepod nauplii. In addition to decreased abundance of most zooplankton groups, community compositions have changed dramatically during the study period, driven by a combination of the introduction and spread of non-native species and changes in the abiotic and biotic environments. Calanoid copepods Calanoid copepod abundance declined only slightly over the study period, but their community composition changed dramatically (Figure 2). When the study began in the early 1970s, the calanoid copepod community was dominated by Eurytemora affinis (an introduced species) and Acartia spp. Even though E. affinis is not a native species, it once comprised the primary prey of the endangered Delta Smelt. However, as its abundance declined, fish increasingly preyed on more recently introduced calanoids like Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Moyle et al. 1992; Slater and Baxter 2014). One of the first recorded calanoid copepod introductions was Sinocalanus doerrii, a freshwater species native to China that invaded the estuary in 1978 and remained the most dominant calanoid species for a decade (Orsi et al. 1983). The calanoid P. forbesi was first detected by this study in October 1987 (Orsi and Walter 1991), shortly after the Potamocorbula amurensis invasion in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer, Gartside, and Orsi 1994; Carlton 1990). Combined effects of these introductions may have influenced subsequent declines in abundances of E. affinis and S. doerrii. P. forbesi quickly became the numerically dominant calanoid in the upper estuary and remains the most abundant to this day. The predatory calanoid copepod Acartiella sinensis was introduced in 1993 and quickly became the second most abundant calanoid in the upper estuary, dominating the low-salinity zone in the Suisun Marsh and Confluence regions (Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). This invasion appears to have narrowed the range of P. forbesi towards freshwater areas of the estuary, potentially in relation to A. sinensis predation on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). Aside from the 25-year high in calanoid copepod abundance in 2017, total abundance was similar from 1995 to 2022 (Figure 2). Although abundance declined in 2021 and again in 2022, these levels remained in the range of the previous two decades. In general, calanoid copepod abundance was highest in the estuary during the summer and fall months (May to November) and lowest during winter months (Figure 3). Distribution of calanoids throughout the estuary in 2022 was similar to recent years, with P. forbesi most abundant in summer and fall months (May to October) in the South Delta and Central Delta and abundant in the North Delta in May and November, though numbers in this region were lower from June to October in the presence of increasing numbers of the predatory Acartiella sinensis (Figure 3). Abundance of A. sinensis was highest from June to December in the Confluence region, with a fall (September to October) peak in Suisun Marsh. In both of these regions, A. sinensis co-occurred with high densities of one of its primary prey items Limnoithona tetraspina (Figure 4). P. forbesi was most abundant in the Central and South Delta regions and was the most common calanoid species in these regions from May to November. In the North Delta region P. forbesi was more abundant in May but declined starting in June, simultaneous with increasing abundance of A. sinensis. P. forbesi abundance was low in Suisun Marsh in 2021 and remained low in 2022. This shift in distribution upstream out of Suisun Marsh could be related to ongoing drought conditions that persisted throughout 2022. There is a marked difference in the calanoid community in the lower reaches of the estuary. Acartia spp. was the only native calanoid commonly found in 2022. These copepods prefer brackish water and were present year-round in San Pablo Bay, though monthly abundances were highly variable (Figure 3). In Suisun and Grizzly Bays, Acartia spp. abundances were low from January to March and essentially absent from April to October but increased in November and comprised about half of the calanoid copepods found in December. This was also the only region where Tortanus spp. was abundant. Eurytemora affinis was the most common calanoid in the North, Central, and South Delta regions in the spring of 2022, similar to seasonal distribution patterns during the last two decades (Figure 3). Cyclopoid copepods In contrast with the general decline of most zooplankton groups during the study period, cyclopoid copepods increased dramatically, particularly during the last decade (2012 to 2022) (Figure 2). Abundances of Oithona spp. and Acanthocyclops copepods were low when the study began, and the increase in cyclopoid abundance resulted from the introduction of Limnoithona sinensis in the early 1980s and subsequent identification of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in 1993 (Ferrari and Orsi 1984; Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). These two species were reported together as Limnoithona spp. from 1980 through 2006. Limnoithona were identified to species starting in 2007, leading to the discovery that L. tetraspina is by far the dominant species. In 2022, L. tetraspina comprised 99.9% of all Limnoithona collected. For the sake of consistency, abundances are combined and reported here as Limnoithona spp. In 2022, Limnothona spp. had the highest abundance of any copepod group monitored in this study (Figure 2). Cyclopoid copepod abundance has increased dramatically since the early 1990s, and the small L. tetraspina has become the most common zooplankton species in the upper estuary (Figure 2). The increase in L. tetraspina abundance was possibly related to decreased predation due to the decline of Northern Anchovy in the upper SFE (Kimmerer 2006). In addition, the small size, high growth rate, and motionless behavior of L. tetraspina may decrease its vulnerability to predation in a region where most fish are visual predators (Bouley and Kimmerer 2006; Greene et al. 2011, Kimmerer 2006). The introduction of L. tetraspina is linked to a change in the distribution of P. forbesi out of the low-salinity zone of the estuary, as higher densities of L. tetraspina may sustain larger populations of the predatory A. sinensis, which also preys on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). Monthly abundances of Limnothona spp. were low in winter and spring and peaked in summer and fall (Figure 4). As in prior years, cyclopoids were most abundant in the low salinity regions of the estuary in 2022, including Suisun Marsh, Suisun and Grizzly Bays, and the Confluence regions (Figure 4). Abundances of Limnothona spp. were high in the North Delta region in September to October, and abundances and monthly patterns were similar to those of P. forbesi in the South Delta and Central Delta regions. Limnothona spp. were virtually absent from San Pablo Bay, where the introduced Oithona davisae was the most abundant cyclopoid in summer and fall (Figure 4). Cladocerans Cladocerans in the upper estuary primarily comprise species in the genera Bosmina, Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, and Diaphanosoma. These populations have declined substantially during the study period (Figure 2). Cladocerans are largely herbivorous and feed primarily on phytoplankton so likely were impacted by the invasion of P. amurensis (Baxter et al. 2008; Kratina and Winder 2015). Cladocerans comprise a significant portion of the diets of Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, and young-of-the-year Striped Bass throughout the upper estuary (Heubach et al. 1963; Slater and Baxter 2014; Goertler et al. 2018). The increased numbers of invasive copepods such as P. forbesi and the decline in native cladocerans has shifted the nutritional content of the planktonic prey available to fish (Kratina and Winder 2015). In the early years of the study, the cladoceran community was dominated by Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia spp. (Figure 2). Over the last decade, cladoceran abundances increased from the low levels in the late 1990s and the community shifted to higher proportions of Ceriodaphnia spp.. and Diaphanosoma spp., though B. longirostris and Daphnia spp.. are still present (Figure 2). In high outflow years cladocerans may be found further downstream, but with low outflow in 2022, abundances were highest in the South and Central Delta regions (Figure 5). All groups except Diaphanosoma spp. were found in the North Delta region from January to March and in December, and in the Confluence region in January (Figure 5). There were trace concentrations of cladocerans in Suisun and Grizzly Bays and Suisun Marsh. Only the “Other Cladocera” group occurred in San Pablo Bay, with CPUE ranging from 100 to 150 in February and March and trace concentrations in other months. Rotifers Although rotifers are the most abundant type of zooplankton in the estuary, their abundance decreased dramatically since the start of the study (Figure 2). Interestingly, the decline in rotifer abundance began in the late 1970s, preceding the invasion by P. amurensis (Cloern and Jassby 2012). The rotifer community comprises species from the genera Polyarthra, Synchaeta, Keratella, and Trichocerca, as well as the “other” rotifer category, which includes the genus Asplanchna. Rotifer abundance and species composition in 2022 were similar to the past few years. Synchaeta spp. were the most abundant, with smaller numbers of Synchaeta bicornis and Keratella spp. (Figure 6). Keratella and Polyarthra tended to be most abundant in freshwater and low-salinity regions, their preferred habitats (Winder and Jassby 2011), while Synchaeta spp. were most abundant in the higher-salinity areas of San Pablo Bay and Suisun and Grizzly Bays. A spatial and temporal split was discernible between Synchaeta and the other rotifer groups, with highest densities of Synchaeta spp. in Suisun March, Suisun and Grizzly Bays, and San Pablo Bay during winter and spring months. There was a noticeable increase in S. bicornis abundance in June in the Confluence, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay regions, though Synchaeta spp. was also present. The “other” rotifers group was most abundant in the South and Central Delta during summer, and moderately abundant in the North Delta in the winter (January and December) (Figure 6). Mysids Mysid abundances were higher overall during the first 12 years of the zooplankton study, with the highest abundance in 1986 (Figure 2). Annual abundances have varied from 2.1 to 29.4 from 1987 to present, with the annual CPUE in 2022 the highest since 1986 (Figure 2). In addition to an overall decline, the community composition shifted dramatically. Prior to 1994, the native Neomysis mercedis was the most abundant species but since 1994 the mysid community has been dominated by the non-native Hyperacanthomysis longirostris (formerly Acanthomysis bowmani) (Figure 2). N. mercedis declined significantly during the 1976-1977 drought, likely related to food limitation from a lack of diatoms due to low river discharges (Siegfried et al. 1979; Cloern et al. 1983). N. mercedis populations rebounded after the drought and abundances remained high in the Suisun Bay region of the upper estuary until the introduction of P. amurensis in the mid-1980s, after which their numbers declined dramatically and remained low. The introduced mysid H. longirostris was first detected by this study in 1993, shortly after the decline of N. mercedis. Although H. longirostris quickly became the most common mysid in the system, mysid abundances have not returned to their pre-clam (Potamocorbula amurensis) invasion levels (Modlin and Orsi 1997, Figure 2). Historically mysids have been critically important in the diets of many fish species in the upper SFE, including Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and Chinook Salmon (Moyle et al. 1992; Feyrer et al. 2003; CDFG 2009; Goertler et al. 2018). The decline of mysids in the upper estuary led to a significant decrease in their presence in fish diets (Feyrer et al. 2003). Overall, mysid abundance increased in 2021 and 2022 compared to the low values from 2018 to 2020 (Figure 2). Total abundance in 2022 was similar to 1987 when the population still comprised the native species N. mercedis. (Figure 2). H. longirostris remained the most common mysid in the estuary, while the abundance of the once dominant native species N. mercedis remained low, continuing the overall trend in mysid community composition since 1994. As in prior years, the mysid community in 2022 was dominated by H. longirostris, with the highest concentrations in the low-salinity zone of Suisun Marsh (Figure 7). Mysids were consistently present in moderate abundances in the Confluence region from March to September. Aside from spikes in Suisun Marsh in May and Suisun and Grizzly Bays in June, mysid abundances were low in all regions in other months. San Pablo Bay was the only region where H. longirostris was not the dominant mysid species, as it prefers low-salinity estuarine habitats. The mysid community in San Pablo Bay comprises the “other” species (Acanthomysis aspera, Acanthomysis hwanhaiensis, and Alienacanthomysis macropsis) but none were abundant at any time of year in this or any other study region (Figure 7). In 2022, mysids were essentially absent from San Pablo Bay from January to April and in September and October (Figure 7). Note that this study samples only the upper portion of San Pablo Bay, so these findings may not represent mysid community dynamics in other areas of San Pablo Bay. Conclusion In 2022, the Zooplankton Study recorded the abundances of calanoids, cladocerans, rotifers, and mysids at abundances comparable to recent years and consistent with historic downward trends in the estuary. Abundances for all zooplankton peaked in summer of 2022. The small, introduced Limnoithona tetraspina remained the most abundant copepod in the upper estuary. Although mysid abundance in 2022 was the highest since 1986, it was low compared to pre-1987 levels and continued to be dominated by the introduced Hypercanthomysis longirostris while the pre-1987 community was dominated by the native Neomysis mercedis. This multi-decade zooplankton study allows researchers and managers to track shifts in zooplankton abundances and community composition across the estuary for over five decades. The Zooplankton Study has documented the introduction and dominance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Hypercanthomysis longirostris, as well as the community’s response to the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Understanding these dynamics and how they have fundamentally changed trophic interactions is critical to assessing food resources for fish and conservation strategies in the San Francisco Estuary.

"],["00-veliger.html", "Veliger Monitoring Program Background Sampling Protocols Contact Info", " Veliger Monitoring Program Background The Zebra/Quagga Mussel Veliger Monitoring Program monitors zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena bugensis) mussel abundance within the Delta. These species were first discovered in Lakes St. Clair and Erie in 1988 and have since expanded their geographic distribution into many other freshwater systems in North America. These mussels were introduced into the Great Lakes by means of discharged ballast water from transoceanic ships that may have contained mussel larvae or possibly juveniles. While zebra and quagga mussels have not been detected in or near the California Delta, the Department of Water Resources’ Zebra and Quagga Mussel Early Detection Monitoring Program aims to monitor the potential spread of zebra and quagga mussels in California waterways. The first stage of the mussel lifecycle is called a veliger, which is a free-swimming planktonic larva that develops miniature bivalve shells and feeds by utilizing its hair-like cilia. Veligers drift with the currents and eventually settle onto hard substrates using sticky secretions. Once settled, they are considered juveniles that eventually develop to sexual maturity, becoming adult mussels after about a year of growth. Zebra and quagga mussels have negative impacts on aquatic food webs by filtering increased amounts of phytoplankton, which then creates a food source deficiency for organisms in higher trophic levels. They also excrete unwanted particulate matter (pseudofeces) that undergoes decomposition, which causes oxygen levels to decrease and toxic byproducts (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) to be released into the water. Zebra and quagga mussels also influence industrial processes by colonizing hard surfaces, placing potential limitations on pumping plants for water distribution. This program sets out to monitor any traces of zebra and quagga mussel veliger DNA throughout the California water system to prevent the negative effects associated with the spread of these introduced mussels. Map of veliger monitoring stations for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Sampling Protocols While this program includes many other regions and sampling methods, the map and sampling protocols listed here are specific to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Sampling for this region takes place once a month at each of the three monitoring stations displayed on the map. At each station, a 45-meter horizontal surface tow is conducted using a 64-micron mesh plankton net. The material collected at the cod end of the net is that of which cannot pass through the 64-micron mesh. These particulates are rinsed into a sample container and submitted to a laboratory for PCR analysis, which determines presence/absence of zebra/quagga mussel veliger DNA. In order to sample all three stations in one day, some nets require decontamination in the field prior to reuse. This decontamination process consists of soaking each net in vinegar for a minimum of one hour and then spraying all surfaces of the net with a 10% bleach solution.
