### Introduction

Water year `r report_year_txt` was classified as `r func_wy(report_year)` in the Sacramento Valley due to ongoing drought; the previous year was classified as `r func_wy(prev_year)` [(source)](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST). Regional facet graphs for `r report_year_txt` were created for each parameter. The minimum and maximum values were determined for each field parameter or laboratory analyte to show that year's range; instances when a result fell below the reporting limit were excluded from these minimum and maximum calculations. When this occurred, for the corresponding graph, a vertical dashed line capped at the reporting limit was used to represent the presence of a non-detect.

### Specific Conductance

Surface specific conductance varied greatly in `r report_year_txt` across the sampling regions with the highest levels occurring in the western regions (San Pablo Bay, Suisun & Grizzly Bays, Confluence) due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. Surface specific conductance ranged from `r func_range('SpCndSurface')`. Median specific conductance values `r func_comparison('SpCndSurface')`.

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Turbidity

Surface turbidity values ranged from `r func_range('TurbiditySurface_FNU')`. Median turbidity values `r func_comparison('TurbiditySurface_FNU')`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', caption = capFig('Turbidity at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary.')}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('admin/figures/dwq/ARGraph_TurbiditySurface.jpg'))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dissolved Ammonia

Dissolved ammonia levels in `r report_year_txt` ranged from `r func_range('DissAmmonia')`. Ammonia levels are typically lower throughout the Delta and Bays, likely due to dilution and nitrification. Median dissolved ammonia values `r func_comparison('DissAmmonia')`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', caption = capFig('Dissolved Ammonia at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary.')}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('admin/figures/dwq/ARGraph_DissAmmonia.jpg'))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chlorophyll *a*

Chlorophyll *a* values in `r report_year_txt` ranged from `r func_range('Chla')`. The highest levels of chlorophyll a were seen in the San Pablo Bay region during August. Median chlorophyll *a* values `r func_comparison('Chla')`. This was due to a harmful algal bloom of *Heterosigma akashiwo*. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', caption=capFig('Chlorophyll a at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary.')}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('admin/figures/dwq/ARGraph_Chla.jpg'))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite

Dissolved nitrate + nitrite levels in `r report_year_txt` ranged from `r func_range('DissNitrateNitrite')`. Median dissolved nitrate/nitrite values `r func_comparison('DissNitrateNitrite')`. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', caption=capFig('Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary.')}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('admin/figures/dwq/ARGraph_DissNitrateNitrite.jpg'))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Total Phosphorus

Total phosphorus levels in `r report_year_txt` ranged from `r func_range('TotPhos')`. Median specific conductance values `r func_comparison('TotPhos')`.The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of total phosphorus concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', caption=capFig('Total Phosphorus at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary.')}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('admin/figures/dwq/ARGraph_TotPhos.jpg'))
